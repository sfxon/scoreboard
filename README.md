# Scoreboard

Use this scoreboard to display your live game scores.

## Project goals

* Build a minimum scoreboard.
* Support the starry cluster ball game known from Youtube in the beginning.
* Build a minimum project which runs alone in the browser first, with no external database. Just use browser database features.
* Later, we might add an online service or database.
* Free for use and open source with basic features.


## Ideas

* We could make that colors for every player could be defined.
  * We always would have a primary and a secondary color, so if colors of 2 players are too close, the system could choose the alternative color scheme. But maybe that is too much overload. We'll see.
