// Add Timer code.
// -> timer.js


// Add setup overlay to html.
// Add setup code functionality.
    // Activate setup by hotkey.
    // Room title (is for internal setup/management)
    // Game title.
    // Game subtitle.
    // Adding players (name, points)
    // Color layout (just some css code entry for now?)
// Add input for points up and down for player 1
// Add input for points up and down for player 2 (e.g. a general class for that, to be able to add multiple player setups in the future).
// Add animation, when player points where added (delayed after an input, so if you add 3 points one after each other, wait for 5 seconds and then display the animation.)
// Add browser database.
// Add some kind of api - for now it uses the browser database - so the browser code for the database will  have an endpoint code-layer, as well as an client code-layer.
