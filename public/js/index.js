// ✓ Add Timer code -> timer.js
// ✓ Add setup overlay to html and it's functionality to admin.js
// Add setup code functionality.
    // ✓ Activate setup by hotkey.
    // ✓ Room title (is for internal setup/management)
    // ✓ Game title.
    // ✓ Game subtitle.
    // ✓ Adding players (name, points)
    // ✓ Select players for current game.

// Continue integration here:
    // Make selected player visible in frontend. Currently the values are not updated. The id's of the active players with their player numbers should be stored in the scoreboard object, too.
    // Add "Start" button to start the game timer. (and print out, that the shortcut button to start stop is the spacebar)
    // Leertaste zukünftig so verwenden, dass sie den Timer startet und stoppt, statt den Dialog zu öffnen und zu schließen.
    // Color layout (just some css code entry for now?)
    // Add max points per round
    // Add max rounds

// Add input for points up and down for player 1
// Add input for points up and down for player 2 (e.g. a general class for that, to be able to add multiple player setups in the future).
// Add animation, when player points where added (delayed after an input, so if you add 3 points one after each other, wait for 5 seconds and then display the animation.)
// Add browser database.
// Add some kind of api - for now it uses the browser database - so the browser code for the database will have an endpoint code-layer, as well as an client code-layer.
// Fix responsive view (css).
