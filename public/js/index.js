        // - Add index db as a browser database to save the state by adding a custom api - for now it uses the browser database - so the browser code for the database will have an endpoint code-layer, as well as a client code-layer.
        // - Build the internal API.
    // Fix responsive view (css).
    // Add keyboard or mouse shortcuts setup.
    // Add switch player sides button.
    // Show highscores with switching leaderboards: sorted by roundsWon, sorted by lifetimePoints, sorted by lifetimeWins
    // Add "Start" button to start the game timer. (and print out, that the shortcut button to start stop is the spacebar)
    // Leertaste zukünftig so verwenden, dass sie den Timer startet und stoppt, statt den Dialog zu öffnen und zu schließen.
    // Color layout (just some css code entry for now?)
    // Make some overlay -> whenever you move the mouse over the scoreboard, buttons should be shown that can change values interactively. Add an option, so that this is always possible -> call it "Touch screen mode".
    // Toggle touch screen mode on, whenever the user just does one touch on the screen, and the scoreboard inputs are deactivated.
    // Re-Design the screen to make it more attractive.
    // Make a video documentation in 2 steps:
    //    - Usage documentation.
